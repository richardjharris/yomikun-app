Implement 'Flutter Starter Project' stuff
 - routes
 - constants
 - per-feature directories
 - no need to implement abstract classes for repositories (can just use 'implements')

Settings page?
 - romaji vs katakana
 - highlight tenten
 - pie chart vs. treemap vs. none?
 - dark/light mode

Bookmarks:
 - bookmark entire page or individual item (?)
 - bookmark system uses URLs which map to routes

Treemap:
 - dakuten, locale

Upgrade to riverpod 2.0.0 and remove extra code.
